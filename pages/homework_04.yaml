    ## Task 1: Notebook

    Run the following notebook and answer the included questions using the method of your choosing:

    <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
    [DOWNLOAD NOTEBOOK](static/homeworks/homework04.ipynb)
    </div>

    For your convenience the notebook is displayed below as HTML but you will likely
    find it easier to download the raw notebook file given above.

    <iframe src="static/homework_htmls/homework04.html" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>

    <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

    To submit your answers, you will need add your `homework04.ipynb` file
    in the `homework04` folder of your **assignments** repository:

    Answer the questions in your notebook file using the method of your choice and
    once you are finished, submit your notebook using the workflow outlined below.

    ## Task 2: Homework Submission Instructions

    To submit your homework answers, you will need add your `homework04.ipynb` file
    in the `homework04` folder of your **assignments** repository:

    Answer the questions in your notebook file using the method of your choice and
    once you are finished, follow the instructions below to submit your notebook.

    1. For this class, you must use a **separate [git] branch for each
    assignment**.  This means that the work for each reading and challenge must
    be done in a separate branch.  To create and checkout a new branch, you can
    do the following:

            :::bash
            $ git checkout main         # Make sure we are in master branch
            $ git pull --rebase           # Make sure we are up-to-date with github repository

            $ git checkout -b homework04   # Create homework00 branch and check it out

        Once you do the above, you should see the following output for the
        [git-branch] command:

            :::bash
            $ git branch
              main
              homework01
              homework02
              homework03
            * homework04

        The `*` indicates that we are currently on the `homework04` branch.

    2. Once you have your notebook filled out, you need to add, commit the file, and
    push your commits to [GitHub]:

            :::bash
            $ git add homework04.ipynb                # Add answers.json to staging area
            $ git commit -m "Homework 02: Done"    # Commit work

            $ git push -u origin homework04        # Push branch to GitHub

        <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
        **Note**: You may edit and commit changes to your branch as many times
        as you wish.  Just make sure all of your work goes in the appropriate
        branch and then perform a `git push` when you are done.
        </div>

    3. When you are ready for your final submission, you need to create a
    **pull request** via the [GitHub] interface:

        - First, go to your repository's **Branches** page and then press the
        **New pull request** button for the appropriate branch:

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_1.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

        - Next, edit the **pull request** title to "Homework 02", write a
          comment if necessary and then press the "Create pull request" button.

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_2.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

        - Finally, assign the **pull request** to the **teaching assistant**
          assigned to you for the given week. 

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_3.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

    <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
    #### <i class="fa fa-gavel"></i> Graders

    Please refer to the [Homework 04 TA List](homework04_tas.html) to determine
    who your grader is for the assignment is.

    </div>

    Once you have made the **pull request**, the instructor or teaching
    assistant can verify your work and provide feedback via the discussion form
    inside the **pull request**.  If necessary, you can update your submission
    by simply committing and pushing to the appropriate branch; the **pull
    request** will automatically be updated to match your latest work.

    When all work is graded, the grader will merge your branch and close the
    **pull request**.

    <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
    **Note**: Please **do not merge** your own **pull request**.  This makes it
    more difficult for the graders to keep track of what needs to be graded.
